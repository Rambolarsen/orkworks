# Private ordinary-session SQLite adapter

Tracking: [#1243](https://github.com/Rambolarsen/orkworks/issues/1243), under the
[accepted storage contract](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-01-sqlite-session-storage-design.md).
This is a source foundation, with no production format selection or live data
migration. Existing `MetadataStore` and organization files remain authoritative.
The issue stays open until the remaining typed internal writers and application
integration are ready; this adapter alone cannot authorize activation.

## Implemented boundary

The private `session_store` module owns canonical JSON and derived SQL columns,
FTS5, organization and identity-bound deletion tombstones. Its worker alone owns
one connection. Staging initialization and existing-store open are distinct;
open never creates a missing database. Unknown versions, workspace mismatches,
corruption and persistence failures return errors instead of an empty store.
No activation marker, JSON mirror, replay deletion or native capability is added.
The future selector must retain the selected workspace lease around this owner.

Current typed commands cover create, revisioned agent patch, exact detail,
live-ID summaries, bounded history/search, batched existence, retention candidates,
organization changes and deletion progress. Agent mutations reuse the current
field/source/plan validators. Canonical records preserve unknown root members,
revision strings and immutable creation identity. Import-specific provenance,
manifest and organization loading remain migration work.

The worker admits at most 32 queued mutations and eight reads, reserves serialized
intent plus possible result bytes against 32 MiB, and rejects intents over 1 MiB.
Reservations survive execution and unread result delivery. Eight FIFO mutations
are followed by one waiting read. Queued expiry uses a two-second execution
cutoff; cancellation after that cutoff never asserts rollback. Close drains admitted
work and closes the connection; Drop requests closure without joining a stalled
worker on the caller's thread. No connection or database mutex is exposed.

Reads capture indexed lightweight summaries, with 8 KiB rows, 256 KiB history
pages and epoch/workspace/generation/query-bound cursors. Complete metadata has
its separate canonical bound. Preview flags preserve the distinction between
shortened display fields and full records. SQL progress hooks limit read
computation; they do not bound filesystem stalls. This is an internal query
contract, not a new HTTP protocol or a measured end-to-end performance result.

## Regression evidence

Real temporary SQLite fixtures exercise:

- Initialization, FTS5 availability, effective durability configuration and strict
  reopen/version/workspace checks without JSON creation or corrupt-file replacement.
- Durable agent patches, stale revisions, source conflict, u64 exhaustion, unknown
  extension preservation, oversized rejection and complete-record round trips.
- Checked organization identity/revisions, close-first actions, archived retention
  protection, non-displayable tombstones, monotonic progress and ID reuse rejection.
- Transaction rollback across canonical rows, search and history generation;
  actual SQLite busy and disk-full errors without false durable acknowledgement.
- Query ordering/ties, stale cursors, literal bounded search, bounded previews,
  selective existence, protected retention and index-backed closed-history ordering.
- Queue count/byte rejection, fairness, before/after-execution cancellation,
  timely queued rejection while storage is stalled and cooperative SQL interruption.
- An independent real Unix PTY exchanges input/output while the worker is paused.
  This validates this isolated worker boundary, not the unchanged application's
  complete runtime integration or the #1247 latency budgets.

Local verification and review results are recorded in the implementation PR.
No supported installed profile, filesystem durability certification, backup/restore,
100k-history memory result or controlled rollout is claimed by these fixtures.

## Remaining writer and authority work

Do not replace existing synchronous closures with worker waits under their
current guards. The concrete traces that still need typed integration are:

| Owner | Preserved cutoff and required next work |
| --- | --- |
| `metadata/session_transactions.rs` | Latest-record optional/decided mutations, no-op revisions/scope clocks and append-before-replace partial effects need corresponding domain intents; never offer arbitrary SQL or execute caller closures on the worker |
| `metadata.rs` Peon/harness merges and session titles | Preserve independent scope source/age arbitration, protected waits, title epochs and append/checkpoint ownership when adding remaining intents |
| `runtime/terminal_runtime.rs` input-derived attention | Currently reads workspace/session guards through a conditional metadata mutation; capture intent and release input-critical guards before any future database await, then revalidate runtime/input authority before publication |
| `runtime/codex_approval_application.rs` ShowWait/ClearWait | Preserve latest-record guards, live/durable ownership pair, freshness, coordinated-writer gate and the exact side-effect/publication ordering; SQL success alone cannot authorize clearing |
| `runtime/codex_completion_application.rs` | Preserve invocation/order correlation and conditional latest-record edits that retain unrelated work; no production stream or eligibility is enabled here |
| `session_application.rs`, lifecycle, archive/retention owners | Retain per-session reservations, workspace/runtime generations, commit-before-spawn, close-first and external evidence owners while changing admission/await boundaries |

[#1244](https://github.com/Rambolarsen/orkworks/issues/1244) must not treat this
foundation as completion of #1243's writer/authority coverage. Backup, qualified
producers, quiescent migration and controlled rollout retain their separate gates.
