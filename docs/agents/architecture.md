## Electron ↔ Rust sidecar communication

`electron/main.ts` spawns `orkworksd` as a child process and discovers its port by reading stdout for the line `ORKWORKSD_PORT=<n>`. The port is dynamic — there is no fixed localhost port. The frontend gets the URL via the preload bridge: `window.orkworks.getBackendUrl()`.

## Packaging and release

Desktop packaging lives under `apps/desktop/`. `electron-builder.yml` defines the product metadata and `extraResources` layout, while `scripts/package-release.mjs` maps the current host platform/arch to the matching Rust target triple, stages the built `orkworksd` binary into `crates/orkworksd/target/release/`, and invokes `electron-builder` with the matching CLI arch flag. CI runs the same path from `.github/workflows/release.yml`, with separate macOS x64 and arm64 jobs so the packaged sidecar always matches the bundled Electron arch.

## Preload bridge (security boundary)

Electron runs with `nodeIntegration: false` and `contextIsolation: true` (ADR 0009). The renderer cannot call Node APIs directly. All privileged operations go through `electron/preload.ts`, which exposes `window.orkworks` with backend discovery, workspace memory, layout memory, menu-command, panel-visibility, and app-settings methods. Adding new capabilities requires extending the preload, not relaxing context isolation.

`electron/layoutMemory.ts` persists the Dockview panel layout to `layout.json` in the Electron user data directory, using the same pattern as `workspaceMemory.ts`. Layout is serialized via Dockview's `toJSON()`/`fromJSON()` on every layout change (debounced 500ms) and restored on startup.

`electron/settingsMemory.ts` owns app-level settings in Electron `userData`, including hotkey validation, default hotkeys, persisted menu accelerators, and durable provider settings (`ProviderSettings`). `getSettings()` and successful `saveHotkeys()` responses include a renderer-facing `defaultHotkeys` copy sourced from the main process, so the settings UI can restore defaults without duplicating canonical accelerators. Electron settings now push both retention and provider settings into the sidecar after port discovery. `electron/providerSettingsSync.ts` handles the `POST /settings/providers` push on startup, workspace switch, and explicit save.

## Frontend → backend API

`apps/desktop/src/api.ts` defines TypeScript types and fetch wrappers for the REST API. `App.tsx` polls `/sessions` every 2 seconds, restores the last active workspace session when `POST /workspace` returns `lastActiveSessionId`, and persists the newly selected active session back through `POST /workspace/active-session`. Session state flows: Rust structs → JSON API → `SessionInfo`/`WorkspaceInfo` TS types → React state → components.

Key endpoints: `POST /workspace`, `POST /workspace/active-session`, `GET/POST /sessions`, `DELETE /sessions/:id`, `POST /sessions/:id/resume`, `GET /sessions/:id/terminal-output`, `WS /sessions/:id/terminal`.

`electron/workspaceMemory.ts` persists the last workspace path and recent workspace directories to the Electron user data directory, enabling workspace restore on relaunch. The sidecar persists repo-local active session memory in `.orkworks/workspace.json`.

## Rust sidecar (`crates/orkworksd/src/`)

Single binary, seven modules:

- `main.rs` — Axum router, `AppState` (sessions + workspace + harness adapters + `ProviderManager`), all HTTP/WS handlers, PTY lifecycle, session resume
- `git.rs` — git2-based context detection (repo root, branch, dirty check including untracked files while excluding ignored files)
- `harness.rs` — harness adapter types, command templates, resume strategy selection, capability flags
- `metadata.rs` — reads/writes `.orkworks/sessions/<id>.json`, `.orkworks/workspace.json`, and `.orkworks/events/<id>.terminal` (terminal output ring buffer) files
- `peon.rs` — observer config, ring buffer, prompt building, inference parsing/validation, source-priority overwrite rules (driven by the debounce loop in `main.rs`; tuning knobs documented in `README.md`)
- `providers.rs` — fixed provider registry, applied-settings store, runtime state, fallback runner (`run_inference` skips disabled/capped providers in fallback order). Exposes `GET /providers` for live runtime state and `POST /settings/providers` for durable settings application. The session Peon loop routes through `ProviderManager::run_inference`.
- `watcher.rs` — `notify`-based file watcher for `.orkworks/` changes

## Dockview panel layout

The renderer uses Dockview for a five-panel workspace: sessions, session detail, terminal, capacity (visible label: Providers), and recommendations. `DockviewApp` owns the panel registration and passes app state through a React context to panel components. `TerminalPanel` hosts the active live PTY session through `CenterPanel` and xterm.js over the backend WebSocket. The `capacity` panel id is kept stable for layout compatibility; the visible title is "Providers".

The titlebar shows the active workspace name and a workspace-switch action when a repo is open. A `ViewMenu` component in the titlebar provides per-panel shortcuts/toggles plus a "Reset Layout" action. Panel layouts persist to Electron userData via `layout.json` and restore on startup via Dockview's `toJSON()`/`fromJSON()` serialization.

The Sessions panel uses Dockview's native header chrome rather than an inner duplicated panel header. In the single-tab case, `DockviewApp` enables Dockview's full-width tab/header mode and renders the "new session" action in the header's right-actions slot so the header still behaves like a tab while matching the rest of the workspace subheader styling. Dockview tabs use a shared default tab component that hides the built-in close affordance; panel visibility is managed through the View menu and shortcuts instead of per-tab close buttons.

- PTY handles only text I/O; voice (native harness) bypasses PTY entirely
